Based on the storage and processing technologies employed, 
it is possible to distinguish four distinct phases of IT 
development: 
<br/>pre-mechanical (3000 BC – 1450 AD),  mechanical (1450–1840), 
electromechanical (1840–1940) and electronic (1940–present).

This article focuses on the most recent period (electronic), 
which began in about 1940.
